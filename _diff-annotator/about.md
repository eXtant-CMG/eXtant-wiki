# About Diff Annotator #
Diff Annotator is a lightweight environment for annotating text-comparisons of two plain text files. It makes use of Node.js, Python, and git diff. After running the text files through a pipeline of git diff (using a token-based comparison) and a Python processing script, the Diff Annotator creates a HTML rendering that is ready to be read, corrected, and annotated, all in the front end.
