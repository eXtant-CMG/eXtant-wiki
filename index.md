# Welcome to the **eXtant** Documentation #

eXtant addresses the demands of scholarly editors looking for digital tools to support them in one or more steps of their workflow, as the complexity of their digital edition requires a high degree of customisation. The new eXtant Toolkit for Digital Scholarly Editing offers ways to enrich digitised documents and their transcriptions and support their publication as a digital edition, but now in the form of a toolkit - a suite of separate applications, tools and models that can be implemented as needed. In addition, the eXtant toolkit is pioneering the editing of born-digital literary works by providing tools for starting an edition project of keystroke logging data.
Currently, the eXtant toolkit consists of Axolotl Collaborative TEI-XML Editor, Bibundina Writerâ€™s Library App, Diff Annotator for Text Comparison and Keystroke Loxensis Visualisation Tool for keystroke logging, and several tools related to HTR. 

Here you can find the documentation for the tools developed in the eXtant toolkit for digital scholarly editing.
