# Keystroke Loxensis Light #

Keystroke Loxensis is also available as a template - [Keystroke Loxensis Light](https://github.com/eXtant-CMG/Keystroke-Loxensis-Light) that allows you to recreate the visualisations offered by Keystroke Loxensis for your own writing processes using GitHub Pages. 

## How to visualise your own keystroke-logged writing processes with Keystroke Loxensis Light ##

To make use of this template, you should have your own keystroke-logged writing processes &mdash; logged with a keystroke logger, such as [Inputlog](https://www.inputlog.net) or [GGXLog](https://www.ggxlog.net) &mdash; encoded in TEI-XML. The XML should be well-formed and must conform to the rules outlined in the [Encoding Manual for Keystroke Logging Data](https://extant-cmg.github.io/eXtant-wiki/loxensis/encoding). Make sure to use [this XML template](https://extant-cmg.github.io/eXtant-wiki/loxensis/encoding/start-file) as the start file for your encoding, this will ensure the metadata (names, session duration etc.) is shown in the visualisations.


### Quick Setup

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=Keystroke-Loxensis-Light&template_owner=eXtant-CMG) to create a new repository.
2. In your new repository, go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions.
3. Go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and Deployment` and select `GitHub Actions` as source.
4. Replace the existing directories (`authorLastname`) in the `xml` folder with your own. Each directory in `xml` represents a collection of writing sessions of one particular writer/author. The folders should be given the lastname of the authors in your collection (e.g. `Smith`). This folder contains all the TEI-XML files, with the following file naming: (`authorLastname_version#_session#.xml`, e.g. `Smith_01_s01.xml`)
5. Commit and push your changes.

If you follow these steps correctly and in the right order, you will kickstart the deployment workflow and your edition will shortly be deployed to `https://[your-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]`.

### Local Development Server Setup

1. [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=Keystroke-Loxensis-Light&template_owner=eXtant-CMG) to create a new repository.
2. Clone your repository to your local system.
4. Replace the existing directories (`authorLastname`) in the `xml` folder with your own. Each directory in `xml` represents a collection of writing sessions of one particular writer/author. The folders should be given the lastname of the authors in your collection (e.g. `Smith`). This folder contains all the TEI-XML files, with the following file naming: (`authorLastname_version#_session#.xml`, e.g. `Smith_01_s01.xml`)
5. Run the Python script `build_authors_json.py` from the root folder of the repository. This will update the `authors.json` file which is necessary for the program to work.
6. Start a local server (eg. [the VCS live server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or a [simple Python HTTP server](https://realpython.com/python-http-server/)) and open `index.html` on a browser.
