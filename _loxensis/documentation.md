## Getting started
Make sure you are logged in into eXist-db. 

## Upload your files
The TEI-XML transcriptions of the keystroke logging data can be easily uploader using the Uploader. Note that your xml must be wellformed and that the filename does not contain any spaces. 

## Open visualisations
Once uploaded the files can be accessed through Files. The default text is the text at the beginning of the writing session. To view the writing actions in the order they were made, use the play button (right side panel), or click through them at your own pace using the arrows. For a static representation, use 'All writing operations' first to see all the writing operations at the same time. Then choose whether you want to see all the deletions, insertions and typos by clicking on the 'Deletions', 'Insertions' or 'Typos' toggles. 'Symbols' shows all writing between symbols. Numbers of revisions' shows the numbers of the order of all changes in the text. The numbers can be enlarged as well. 'Writing path' shows the path the writer took through the text and shows how linear the writing session was.
