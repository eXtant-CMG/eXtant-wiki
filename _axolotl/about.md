# About Axolotl
Axolotl Collaborative XML Editor provides a specialised platform for collaborative editing, enabling scholars to refine and enrich transcriptions of handwritten sources within the TEI-XML framework. As a web application developed using React and Node.js, Axolotl is designed to address the challenges associated with HTR post-processing, while offering real-time collaborative editing capabilities and overcoming limitations of generic and/or non-collaborative tools. Its key features in addition to real-time collaborative editing include XML validation, autocomplete suggestions, real-time cursor view, and annotation support. Axolotl is fully open-source, fostering academic collaboration and accessibility.
