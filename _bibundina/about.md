# About Bibundina: a Writer's Library App
Bibundina is a writer's library application that provides an environment for creating and publishing an edition of a collection of books and the reading traces in them. This edition can contain not only the bibliographic details of the books, but also focus on the marginalia left by writers and include information about the provenance of the books and when they were read.
